###Django Caching Middleware

This is a Django middleware that takes a list of URLs from the settings file and caches them by checking a
list `CACHE_URL` in `settings.py`, e.g. `CACHE_URL=[(r'^api/v1/test', 60*60)]`.
The Middleware should checks the requested URL and cache the page for the duration specified in `settings.py` `CACHE_URL` variable. 
If the page was found in the cache, return the cached result and donâ€™t process the page.

In this repo code to achieve the explanation above has been written, that's my best implementation of such, 
if you have a better approach please make a PR.

#####Tech Stack
* Redis for caching
* Django as my server
* Python 2.7 as my runtime

#####How to run the project
* `brew install redis` if on a mac or `sudo apt-get install redis` on ubuntu.
* `redis-server` on your terminal.
* create a virtual environment and activate it.
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python manage.py runserver`
* then visit `/`, `/test1/`, `/test2/` to see the action.

To find the middleware code `cd pawame/core/` then open `middleware.py`.

May the python be with you.
